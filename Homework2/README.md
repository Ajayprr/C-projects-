Description:

Write a program replicating the Caesar cipher. The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest encryption techniques. It was used by Julius Caesar to encrypt his private correspondence. It is sometimes called shift cipher because each letter in the unencrypted message is replaced by a different letter which is a fixed number of places down the alphabet (hence shifting).
